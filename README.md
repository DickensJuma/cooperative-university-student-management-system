# cooperative-university-student-management-system

This is a student management system project written in C language. It is designed to help manage and store student data, such as student name, department, admission number, semester marks, and average grade.

The program features functions such as adding students, modifying student records, displaying all students, viewing individual student records, deleting student records, and changing the password of the program. It also has a graphical user interface and a login feature.

To use the program, simply compile the code and run it on a C compiler. The program will then prompt you to enter a password before allowing you access to the main menu. From there, you can select the desired function and use it.
